Customer reviews are vital for fashion brands to grow and improve. Businesses make informed 
decisions based on user feedback to enhance their products. However, issues can arise during the 
review analysis process. There may be numerous reviews to sift through, as well as emotional 
biases on the part of humans, and other factors that can impede accurate sentiment prediction in 
studies. This is a problem for the e-commerce store because when they cannot determine the 
intention and meaning the user is trying to communicate, thus do not fulfill the need for the 
online review system.
Using machine learning alongside lexicon-based NLP techniques to help determine the sentiment 
in customer reviews will help create a robust hybrid system.
